        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
                My name is Krystle Noweski and I am an aspiring Fullstack Web Developer based out of the Jersey Shore area.
                While I did not take the traditional career path to get to this role, I have always had an interest
                in computers and design. 
        </p>
        <p>
                I vividly remember my parents purchasing our first computer when I was about
                10 years old and spending hours designing my own websites using HTML. I have always been interested in
                how computers work. After spending years using my attention to detail and problem solving abilities in the
                legal field as a Paralegal, I decided to make a change and enroll in Thinkful's Engineering Bootcamp Immersion.
                With so many jobs becoming automated and technology becoming such a huge part of our daily lives, I felt that coding was a
                fundamental skill I should learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                I spend my time riding my bike, hiking, and cooking. I am an animal lover
                with two cats and a collector of tattoos, including a portrait of Ada Lovelace, who many consider the first female computer
                programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                My non-traditional background allows me to approach problems from a different perspective. My creativity and persistence allows
                me to consistently create high quality work. I love working with others and being a part of a team. I am someone who loves to learn new skills and is always trying to gain new
                knowledge. I truly feel that no matter how much you know about a subject, there is always room to learn more.
