        <p>
                My name is Krystle Noweski and I am a Fullstack Web Developer based out of the Jersey Shore area.
                While I did not take the traditional career path to get to this role, I have always had an interest
                in computers and design. I vividly remember my parents purchasing our first computer when I was about
                10 years old and spending hours designing my own websites using HTML. I have always been interested in 
                how computers work. After spending years using my attention to detail and problem solving abilities in the 
                legal field as a Paralegal, I decided to make a change and enroll in Thinkful's Engineering Bootcamp Immersion. 
                With so many jobs becoming automated and technology becoming such a huge part of our daily lives, I felt that coding was a 
                fundamental skill I should learn.

                When I am not expanding my technical abilities, I spend my time riding my bike, hiking, and cooking.  I am an animal lover
                with two cats and a  collector of tattoos, including a portrait of Ada Lovelace, who many consider the first female computer 
                programmer.

                 My non-traditional background allows me to approach problems from a different perspective. My creativity and persistence allows 
                me to consistently create high quality work.  I am someone who loves to learn new skills and is always trying to gain new 
                knowledge. I truly feel that no matter how much you know about a subject, there is always room to learn more.
