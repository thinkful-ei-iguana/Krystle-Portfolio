    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Krystle Noweski and I am a Fullstack Web Developer based out of the Jersey Shore area.
    While I did not take the traditional career path to get to this role, I have always had an interest
    in computers and design. I vividly remember my parents purchasing our first computer when I was about
    10 years old and spending hours designing my own websites using html. I have always been interested in 
    how computers work. After spending years using my attention to detail and problem solving abilities in the 
    legal field, I decided to make a change and enroll in Thinkful's Engineering Bootcamp Immersion.
